👋 Hello, I’m Marti!

- 📚 I am currently a Computer Systems Technology (CST) student at BCIT, looking to absorb as much knowledge as I can in the tech field!

- 🛠 I can code in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In addition, I am actively learning Procedural Programming in C, and Object Oriented Programming in Java. 

- 🧑‍💻 My future goals include: building a foundation in machine learning, and I hope to be able to leverage my tech skills and creative pursuits, to help build software application in music production and marketing.
